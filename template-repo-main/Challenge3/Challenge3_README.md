## Challenge 3: Visualization and Explanation

After digging into the data and developing classifiers, the third challenge will give you a chance to showcase the journey you took in a compelling story. Challenge 3 will be a summary of the work you completed in Challenge 1 and Challenge 2 focused on: Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Performance. This challenge provides for a chance to describe the creativity of the completed or proposed solution, unique or intersting aspects, and ideas about the application of AI and ML that might be necessary to use your solution in real-world scenario.  

* Challenge 3 will be a summary of work from both Challenge 1 and Challenge 2 and submitted as a PowerPoint presentation.

* Submissions will be a PowerPoint containing the team’s best descriptions and images to explain the work, the results, and other aspects learned and created during the event.

* PowerPoint should be and 1-3 slides per section. (See “Challenge 3 Submission Template” for more details)

* After Challenge 3 has ended, submissions will be judged by data scientists and subject matter experts using the below grading criteria.

The below are inspiration for each section but not limited to the following:

**1) Exploratory Data Analysis**
* Feature Importance
* Feature Correlation
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  


**2) Model Performance**
* Confusion Matrix
* Cross-validated Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve
* Learning Curve

## Challenge 3 Submission Instructions

Challenge 3 has just one submission part:
1) Place your Challenge 3 PowerPoint file in the appropriate folder in your team’s Git repository.


## Challenge 3 Submission Deadline

Submit your final work for Challenge 2 and Challenge 3 by 1700 EST on Thursday, 18 November.

## Challenge 3 Grading

Challenge 3 will be graded by a judging panel that will use the following criteria as a grading rubric to assign points to submissions. 

**Challenge 3 is worth a total of 15 points.**

| Criteria | Description | Criteria % Weight |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
|**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Content** |Patterns, relationships, features found. Anything of interest while exploring the dataset. Points given based on the level of effort and relevance of content provided. |10 |
|**Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualization** | How meaningful is the story their visualizations tell? Did participants choose viz elements that seem appropriate to clearly and concisely telling the intended story? Are there unnecessary elements? Are there misguiding elements (things that misrepresent the underlying data)? Attention to detail: grid line size, color choices, readability etc. |30 |
|**Model Performance: Content** |Model Performance Metrics (Confusion Matrix, ROC, Learning Curve, Optimization techniques, ensemble). Points given based on the level of effort and relevance of content provided. |10 |
|**Model Performance: Visualizations** |How meaningful is the story their visualizations tell? Did participants choose viz elements that seem appropriate to clearly and concisely telling the intended story? Are there unnecessary elements? Are there misguiding elements (things that misrepresent the underlying data)? Attention to detail: grid line size, color choices, readability etc. |30 |
|**Ingenuity** |Creativity of overall solution, unique methods used, clever work-arounds, novelty of techniques. Also will consider research or outside resources used to understand or build on the current state of the art in this domain. |20 |
