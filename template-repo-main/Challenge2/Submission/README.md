# Submission

Challenge 2 submission process is almost exactly the same as Challenge 1.

You will be creating a Docker image and submitting it just as you did in Challenge 1,
the only exception is the image registry repository that you will tag and push your image to.

We will provide you with specific guidance of the image repository name to submit your Challenge 2 images.

Please refer to /Challenge1/Submission/README.md for more details about how to build your Docker image and submit it.
